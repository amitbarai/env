Configuration files 
==================
/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ - contains global configuration file like heira.conf, auth.conf, puppet.conf and ssl directory. 
/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver- contains configuration files related to server logs using config file logback.xml, request-logging.xml file and directory conf.d, services.d.
/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/conf.d- 
List File and Settings File
global.conf
webserver.conf
web-routes.conf

auth.conf
master.conf (deprecated)
ca.conf (deprecated)
 
/etc/sysconfig/puppet - parmeter file for puppet service
/etc/sysconfig/puppetserver - environment specific parameters

Flow to write puppet code
--------------------------
create > check > test > Run
1. write down > 
2. #puppet parser validate 
3. #puppet apply --noop 
4. #puppet apply 

# puppet parser validate <exaple.pp>       --> To check syntax
# puppet apply <exmple.pp> --noop          --> To run manifest to check what changes would be applied 
# puppet apply <exmple.pp>		           --> To run manifests

To get help
===========
#puppet help 

Classes
=======
classes - bundle of resources, class name should be unique and can be declared once.
It will be applied only when "include" (declared in code).
Classes must be unique and declared only once.


Example
-------
class class_name {
  service { 'title':
    ensure => 'present'
  }
  file { 'title':
    ensure => 'present'
  }
}
include class_name


Manifests
---------
Puppet language file called manifest with .pp extension 
/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp -- main manifest file or first entry point for puppet creation.

Flow to write puppet code for multiple nodes
--------------------------
create > check > test > Run
#write down > #puppet parser validate > #puppet agent -tv --noop > #puppet agent -tv 

# puppet parser validate <exaple.pp>		--> To check syntax
# puppet agent -tv --noop 					--> To run manifest to check what changes would be applied on agent nodes
# puppet agent -tv		   					--> To run manifests on agent node

Node 
----
- Node is use to run manifests on particular host file.
- To avoid confusion we never write class/role/resource/profile in site.pp file.
- site.pp file is used to manage node (host inventory)

node 'name' {
  include ntp_service
}

variables
---------
Variables are always start with $ sign (eg $var) 
$var = "value1"
file { "/etc/ntp.conf" :
	ensure  => "present",
	content => "$var"
}

factor
------
it provides information and facts about the system
# factor
# factor os
# factor os.release.full

modules
-------
It is self content about class (content about resources) and data. 
It has own directory structure and manifests
modules           #
└── downcased_module_name/ 
	 ├── files/ 
	 ├── manifests/ 
	 │	 └── init.pp 
	 ├── lib/ 
	 │	 ├── puppet/ 
	 │	 ├── parser/ 
	 │	 │   └── functions 
	 │	 ├── provider/ 
	 │	 ├── type/ 
	 │	 └── facter/ 
	 ├── templates/ 
	 ├── facts.d/
	 ├── examples/

	 └── README
- assign modules directly into manifest is not good practice for complex environment due to which created profiles and roles invented 

Profile
-------
It is bundle of multiple modules

Roles
------ 
It is bundle of profiles


Hiera
-----
it allow to store data which is part of puppet code in separated file hiera.yml file. Puppet modules can lookup for data which need in hiera.

#cat hiera.yml
---
ntp::servers:
  - pool.ntp.org
  

Mcollective  
-----------
mco is framework which turn pull based model to push based module to perform quick and hot task from puppet master to node agent.
# puppet config print | grep -i module --> To view puppet 	default modules in directory
